abstract = {Multisensor fusion and integration is a rapidly evolving research area and requires interdisciplinary knowledge in control theory, signal processing, artificial intelligence, probability and statistics, etc. The advantages gained through the use of redundant, complementary, or more timely information in a system can provide more reliable and accurate information. This paper provides an overview of current sensor technologies and describes the paradigm of multisensor fusion and integration as well as fusion techniques at different fusion levels. Applications of multisensor fusion in robotics, biomedical system, equipment monitoring, remote sensing, and transportation system are also discussed. Finally, future research directions of multisensor fusion technology including microsensors, smart sensors, and adaptive fusion techniques are presented. © 2002 IEEE.},

abstract = {The decision-making processes in an autonomous mechatronic system rely on data coming from multiple sensors. An optimal fusion of information from distributed multiple sensors requires robust fusion approaches. The science of multisensor fusion and integration (MFI) is formed to treat the information merging requirements. MFI aims to provide the system a more accurate perception enabling an optimal decision to be made. The wide application spectrum of MFI in mechatronic systems includes industrial automation, the development of intelligent robots, military applications, biomedical applications, and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)/nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). This paper reviews the theories and approaches of MFI with its applications. Furthermore, sensor fusion methods at different levels, namely, estimation methods, classification methods and inference methods, are the most frequently used algorithms. Future perspectives of MFI deployment are included in the concluding remarks. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {In the literature there exist many proposed architectures for sensor fusion applications. This paper briefly reviews some of the most common approaches, i. e., the JDL fusion architecture, the Wa- terfall model, the Intelligence cycle, the Boyd loop, the LAAS archi- tecture, the Omnibus model, Mr. Fusion, the DFuse framework, and the Time-Triggered Sensor Fusion Model, and categorizes them into ab- stract models, generic and rigid architectures. While an abstract model does not guide the designer in the concrete implementation, the generic architectures provide a generic design but leave open several design deci- sions regarding operating system, hardware, communication system, or database system. Rigid architectures specify at least some of these as- pects and therefore provide existing hardware designs, tools, and source code at the cost of flexibility},

@techreport{Bostrom2007,
abstract = {A more precise definition of the field of information fusion can be of benefit to researchers within the field, who may use such a definition when motivating their own work and evaluating the contribution of others. Moreover, it can enable researchers and practitioners outside the field to more easily relate their own work to the field and more easily understand the scope of the techniques and methods developed in the field. Previous definitions of information fusion are reviewed from that perspective, including definitions of data and sensor fusion, and their appropriateness as definitions for the entire research field are discussed. Based on strengths and weaknesses of existing definitions, a novel definition is proposed, which is argued to effectively fulfill the requirements that can be put on a definition of information fusion as a field of research},
