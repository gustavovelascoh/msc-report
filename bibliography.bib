abstract = {Crashes often occur at intersections because these are the locations where two or more roads cross each other and activities such as turning left, crossing over, and turning right have the potential for conflicts resulting in crashes. In order to understand the crash scenarios at intersections, this study examines general characteristics of motor vehicle traffic crashes at intersections by analyzing the association of the critical reason with several crash factors such as driver’s sex and age, traffic control device, critical pre-crash event, and atmospheric condition. The National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey data collected at crash scenes between 2005 and 2007 is used in statistical analyses such as descriptive analysis, generalized logit model, and configural frequency analysis. Descriptive statistics are first used to highlight characteristics of the intersection-related crashes. The results from this analysis provide guidelines for in-depth analysis. Close associations of crash factors with critical reasons of an event that made the crash imminent are revealed through the analysis of generalized logit model. Subsequently, the configural frequency analysis is used to identify patterns of driver-attributed critical reasons in the intersection-related crashes in terms of crash factors such as traffic control devices, pre-crash event, and driver’s age and sex. Many interesting findings are obtained in this study. For example, crash occurrence may be attributed to illegal maneuver or inattention while crossing over at intersections controlled by traffic signals or stop signs. For both male and female drivers 55 and older, crash occurrence may be attributed to misjudgment of gap or other’s speed and inadequate surveillance. Male drivers of all ages are likely to be involved in intersection-related crashes due to illegal maneuver or driving aggressively or too fast for conditions.},

abstract = {Automatic video analysis from urban surveillance cameras is a fast-emerging field based on computer vision techniques. We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing de- ployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human oper- ators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct com- parison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evalu- ation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.},

The cooperative sensor data fusion is based on state-of-the-art and advanced on-board sensors for object recognition and relative localisation, a standard navigation map and information from other road users, infrastructure sensors and traffic lights. We created a traffic safety model for the INTERSAFE-2 system. The system incorporates a high level fusion module and local dynamic maps database that store static intersection topology. Furthermore, risk assessment from the infrastructure side has been performed in order to detect potentially dangerous situations, and to determine when the system should give a warning in order to prevent a possible collision. To evaluate the safety algorithm, video sequences of two intersections in Helsinki are used, which were processed with a generic tool for image processing and traffic monitoring. I.},

Evaluating intersections control is complex and difficult. Given this, intersection manage- ment is both costly and time consuming. This paper considers the potential benefits of enhancing the traffic intersection with the use of intelligent objects in vehicles. We present, compare and demonstrate a novel Vehicle Back-Off Protocol against a classical Timed Traffic Control system. Our protocol uses ad-hoc messaging, collision avoidance and shared journey plans as a means by which to reduce delay, adapt a journey and maximise the efficient usage of a traffic intersection. We use simulation to model and evaluate intersection control.},

abstract = {Nearly one third of all documented vehicle collisions are reported at urban and rural intersections, and this number continues to rise in spite of technological innovations for vehicle safety. Most collision avoidance systems currently under investigation are based on road-vehicle or inter-vehicle communication. However, reliability remains an issue, as high mobility often leads to message collisions and link breakage. In this paper reliable, real-time intersection collision avoidance (ICA) system based solely on infrastructure communication is proposed. ICA utilizes telematics and wireless sensor networks (WSN) to monitor approaching traffic, detect possible collision, and then transfer information to drivers, warning them of high collision probability.},

abstract = {This paper describes an intelligent traffic man- agement system applied to road intersections, namely round- about and crossroads. A microscopic traffic simulator was developed to study intelligent traffic management techniques and evaluate their performance. The intelligent management techniques are aimed to minimize accidents, traffic congestion and consequently the environmental costs of road traffic. Each vehicle is modeled by an agent and each agent provides information depending on its vehicle sensors. Two intersection types, roundabout and crossroads, were simulated each using its intelligent traffic management system. Both intersections use an algorithm based on a spatio-temporal reservation scheme. The envisioned intelligent traffic management algorithm is supported by vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, allowing the exchange of information between vehicles and the intersection intelligent traffic management system. The developed intelligent traffic management system is very well suited for autonomous vehicles, it can also be used by human drivers if they follow accurately the proposed speed profile along the path.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving au- tomobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transporta- tion safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Cur- rent methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers’ actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology—traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.},

Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control protocol called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed that with autonomous vehicles it is possible to make intersection control much more efficient than the traditional control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. The protocol, however, has only been tested in simulation and has not been evaluated with real autonomous vehicles. To realistically test the protocol, we implemented a mixed reality platform on which an autonomous vehicle can interact with multiple virtual vehicles in a simulation at a real intersection in real time. From this platform we validated realistic parameters for our autonomous vehicle to safely traverse an intersection in AIM. We present several techniques to improve efficiency and show that the AIM protocol can still outperform traffic signals and stop signs even if the cars are not as precisely controllable as has been assumed in previous studies.},

Based on strengths and weaknesses of existing definitions, a novel definition is proposed, which is argued to effectively fulfill the requirements that can be put on a definition of information fusion as a field of research},

By using computer based field of view modelling the sensor positions are carefully selected to avoid occlusions. Thus, the infrastructure perception system provides a bird's eye view. Our experiments show that spatial and temporal alignment of sensor data is achieved.

Moreover, the motion characteristics and with that the appropriate motion model depends on the object’s class. In this contribution a classifying multiple-model probability hypothesis density filter based on Dempster-Shafer theory is proposed. The object class is estimated based on features of the measurement as well as features of the estimated objects’ states. Furthermore, the transition probabilities between the model modes are not static, but adapted with the estimated class probabilities of each track. It is shown, that a single multiple model filter is able to track multiple road users with different motion characteristics. Additionally, the integration of the Dempster-Shafer based classification in the filter framework improves the object class estimation significantly. Finally, an application of the filter on real world data of an intersection perception system is presented. I.},

Therefore, an intersec- tion-based perception system provides a dynamic model of the inter- section scene to the vehicles. Based on that, the intersection perception facilitates to discriminate occlusions which is expected to signifi- cantly reduce the number of accidents at intersections. Therefore this contribution presents a general purpose multi-sensor tracking algo- rithm, the classifying multiple-model probability hypothesis density (CMMPHD) filter, which facilitates the tracking and classification of relevant objects using a single filter. Due to the different motion char- acteristics, a multiple-model approach is required to obtain accurate state estimates and persistent tracks for all types of objects. Addition- ally, an extension of the PHD filter to handle contradictory measure- ments of different sensor types based on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is proposed. The performance of tracking and classification is evaluated using real world sensor data of a public intersection.},

abstract = {In our previous work, we reported a system that monitors an intersection using a network of horizontal laser scanners. This paper focuses on an algorithm for moving-object detection and tracking, given a sequence of distributed laser scan data of an intersection. The goal is to detect each moving object that enters the intersection; estimate state parameters such as size; and track its location, speed, and direction while it passes through the intersection. This work is unique, to the best of the authors' knowledge, in that the data is novel, which provides new possibilities but with great challenges; the algorithm is the first proposal that uses such data in detecting and tracking all moving objects that pass through a large crowded intersection with focus on achieving robustness to partial observations, some of which result from occlusions, and on performing correct data associations in crowded situations. Promising results are demonstrated using experimental data from real intersections, whereby, for 1063 objects moving through an intersection over 20 min, 988 are perfectly tracked from entrance to exit with an excellent tracking ratio of 92.9\%. System advantages, limitations, and future work are discussed.},

abstract = {Analyzing and monitoring traffic behav- ior at intersection is considered very important to reduce accidents, solve traffic jam and improve its accessibility. However such a data is not easy to ob- tain, as the visual-based systems require high sensor setting conditions, which could not be met easily in many traffic environments. In this research, we propose a novel system of monitoring and collecting a traffic data at an intersection using a single-row laser range scanner, which is set on a roadside, horizontally profiles the moving objects at the intersection at an elevation about 40cm from the ground. A method of joint tracking and classification is developed by spatially and temporally processing on laser scan data, where moving objects are classified into 0-axis object (e.g. pedestrians), 1-axis object (e.g. bicycles), 2-axis object (e.g. cars, trucks, buses).Anobjectmodel is de- fined by picking up the typical appearances (Markov States) of an object in an instant laser measurement, and modeling each traffic flow as the transition along a chain of the Markov States (Markov Chain). An accurate estimation to the shape of the object, e.g. width and length, side vectors, corner points, etc., and kinematic parameters, e.g. position, direction, speed is achieved by integrating such a partially (at each Markov State) but continuously (transitions along a Markov Chain) collected knowledge to the object. An experiment is conducted in an intersection, where a SICK LMS291 is applied to collect laser data for tracking and classifying of the moving objects at the intersection, a video image is recorded to make a bet- ter understanding to the results. A ten-minute data is processed, where a successful ratio of above 95\% is found by examining the results on both laser data and video images. In this experiment, although the data areprocessedinanoff-linemode, alow computation cost (less than half of the scanning period is cost for the processing of each frame) is found of the method, which proved the possibility for a on-line system.},

A common theme of these models is the existence of multiple levels of processing within the data fusion process. In the 1980’s three models were adopted: the intelligence cycle, the JDL model and the Boyd control. The 1990’s saw the introduction of the Dasarathy model and the Waterfall model. However, each of these models has particular advantages and disadvantages. A new model for data and information fusion is proposed. This is the Omnibus model, which draws together each of the previous models and their associated advantages whilst managing to overcome some of the disadvantages.

Population characteristics from these studies are compared with results from a 1977-79 study in sandstone escarpment country 40 km to the south-east and from studies in a range of habitats on the Mitchell Plateau in the Kimberley. Populations in rocky country are most dense with animals often surviving two or three years. In contrast, populations in savanna are more sparse, with males and females rarely surviving beyond one mating season. While all populations seem to undergo an annual period of stress, it is the savanna populations that seem most vulnerable. An analysis of the distribution of northern quolls shows a 75\% recent range reduction, from being widespread over much of northern Australia to six smaller rocky regions. Possible causes of the decline include cattle, cane toads and exotic disease.},

We have developed an architectural framework, DFuse, for answering these two questions. It consists of a data fusion API and a distributed algorithm for energy-aware role assignment. The fusion API enables an application to be specified as a coarse-grained dataflow graph, and eases application development and deployment. The role assignment algorithm maps the graph onto the network, and optimally adapts the mapping at run-time using role migration. Experiments on an iPAQ farm show that, the fusion API has low-overhead, and the role assignment algorithm with role migration significantly increases the network lifetime compared to any static assignment.},

@article{Kamijo2000,
abstract = {Among the most important research in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the development of systems that automatically monitor traffic flow at intersections. Rather than being based on global flow analysis as is currently done, these automatic monitoring systems should be based on local analysis of the behavior of each vehicle at the intersection. The systems should be able to identify each vehicle and track its behavior, and to recognize situations or events that are likely to result from a chain of such behavior. The most difficult problem associated with vehicle tracking is the occlusion effect among vehicles. In order to solve this problem we have developed an algorithm, referred to as spatio-temporal Markov random field (MRF), for traffic images at intersections. This algorithm models a tracking problem by determining the state of each pixel in an image and its transit, and how such states transit along both the – image axes as well as the time axes. Vehicles, of course, are of various shapes and they move in random fashion, thereby leading to full or partial occlusion at intersections. Despite these complications, our algorithm is sufficiently robust to segment and track occluded vehicles at a high success rate of 93\%–96\%. This success has led to the development of an extendable robust event recognition system based on the hidden Markov model (HMM). The system learns various event behavior patterns of each vehicle in theHMMchains and then, using the output from the tracking system, identifies current event chains. The current system can recognize bumping, passing, and jamming.However, by including other event patterns in the training set, the system can be extended to recognize those other events, e.g., illegal U-turns or reckless driving. We have implemented this system, evaluated it using the tracking results, and demonstrated its effectiveness.},

Some of the key elements for robust intersection monitoring are camera calibration, motion tracking, incident detection, etc. In this paper, we consider the motion-tracking problem. A multilevel tracking approach using Kalman filter is presented for tracking vehicles and pedestrians at intersections. The approach combines low-level image-based blob tracking with high-level Kalman filtering for position and shape estimation. An intermediate occlusion-reasoning module serves the purpose of detecting occlusions and filtering relevant measurements. Motion segmentation is performed by using a mixture of Gaussian models which helps us achieve fairly reliable tracking in a variety of complex outdoor scenes. A visualization module is also presented. This module is very useful for visualizing the results of the tracker and serves as a platform for the incident detection module.},

Therefore, a driver assistance system supporting the driver to negotiate intersections is highly desirable and has a tremendous potential of reducing the number of collisions at intersections. What makes intersection assistance more challenging than other traffic scenarios such as highways and rural roads? On one hand, the environment all around the vehicle must be monitored. A very large field of view for the local sensors is required. We decided to use both omnidirectional cameras for a panoramic view and active cameras to inspect smaller areas around us at a high resolution. On the other hand, intersections come in all shapes, sizes, and signal regulations. Hence, some prior knowledge of the signal mode and the intersection geometry is very helpful. This can be achieved via GPS in conjunction with an attributed digital map. We propose a system architecture for intersection assistance using image, map, and GPS information to issue the typical intersection warnings such as cross traffic warning or traffic light warning.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an automatic vehicles counting, classification and tracking for identifying Traffic flows in an intersection which is a fundamental task for video surveillance in urban traffic management. In intelligent transportation systems (ITS), especially in field of urban traffic management, intersections monitoring is one of the critical and challenging tasks. Where, objects have different characteristics such as varying velocities, stop and go. Therefore it is necessary to use a hybrid scheme of adaptive background mixture model to learn background model faster and more accurately, instead of using single rate of adaptation, which is not adequate. The main focus of this paper is to analyze activities at intersection in number of traffic zones for counting and classifying vehicles and then tracking to extract traffic flows which assists in regulating traffic lights for using in smart cameras. Traffic zones definition in intersection video, based on trajectories clustering; greatly reduce the time and volume of computations. Smart camera's fundamental purpose is to efficiently reduce the transmission rate and also analyze an intersection scene and report statics and information of interest which is not an image. Ground-truth experiments with urban traffic sequences show that our proposed algorithm is very promising relative to results using other techniques.},

@article{Au2010,
abstract = {The impressive results of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge showed that fully autonomous vehicles are technologically feasible with current intelligent vehicle hardware. It is natural to ask how current transportation infrastructure can be improved when most vehicles are driven autonomously in the future. Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control mechanism called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed in simulation that intersection control can be made more efficient than the traditional control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. In this paper, we extend the study by examining the relationship between the precision of cars' motion controllers and the efficiency of the intersection controller. We propose a planning-based motion controller that can reduce the chance that autonomous vehicles stop before intersections, and show that this controller can increase the efficiency of the intersection control mechanism.},

@techreport{AdamsBoxill2000,
abstract = {Tools to evaluate traffic networks under information supply are a vital necessity in light of the systems being implemented as part of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) deployment plan. One such tool is the traffic simulation model. This report presents an evaluation of the existing traffic simulation models to identify the models that can be potentially applied in ITS equipped networks. The traffic simulation models are categorized according to type (macroscopic, microscopic, or mesoscopic), as well as functionality (highway, signal, integrated). The entire evaluation is conducted through two steps: initial screening and in- depth evaluation. The initial step generates a shorter but more specific list of traffic simulation models based on some pre-determined criteria. The in-depth evaluation identifies which model on the shorter list is suitable for a specific area of ITS applications. It is concluded from this research that presently CORSIM and INTEGRATION appear to have the highest probability of success in real-world applications. It is also found that by adding more calibration and validation in the U.S., the AIMSUN 2 and PARAMICS models will be brought to the forefront in the near term for use with ITS applications},

Results of the intersection perception can be communicated to equipped vehicles by wireless communication. This contribution wants to share a dataset of the Ko-PER intersection to the research community for further research in the field of multi-object detection and tracking. Therefor the dataset consists of sensor data from the laserscanners network and cameras as well as reference data and object labels.
