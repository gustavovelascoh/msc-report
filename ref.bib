abstract = {Crashes often occur at intersections because these are the locations where two or more roads cross each other and activities such as turning left, crossing over, and turning right have the potential for conflicts resulting in crashes. In order to understand the crash scenarios at intersections, this study examines general characteristics of motor vehicle traffic crashes at intersections by analyzing the association of the critical reason with several crash factors such as driver’s sex and age, traffic control device, critical pre-crash event, and atmospheric condition. The National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey data collected at crash scenes between 2005 and 2007 is used in statistical analyses such as descriptive analysis, generalized logit model, and configural frequency analysis. Descriptive statistics are first used to highlight characteristics of the intersection-related crashes. The results from this analysis provide guidelines for in-depth analysis. Close associations of crash factors with critical reasons of an event that made the crash imminent are revealed through the analysis of generalized logit model. Subsequently, the configural frequency analysis is used to identify patterns of driver-attributed critical reasons in the intersection-related crashes in terms of crash factors such as traffic control devices, pre-crash event, and driver’s age and sex. Many interesting findings are obtained in this study. For example, crash occurrence may be attributed to illegal maneuver or inattention while crossing over at intersections controlled by traffic signals or stop signs. For both male and female drivers 55 and older, crash occurrence may be attributed to misjudgment of gap or other’s speed and inadequate surveillance. Male drivers of all ages are likely to be involved in intersection-related crashes due to illegal maneuver or driving aggressively or too fast for conditions.},

Recent research and development activities have suggested potential solutions to address this critical safety issue by supplying timely alerts to drivers of imminent collisions. These intersection decision support systems utilized sensor, communication and computer technoIogies to help drivers recognize risky conditions, thus actions can be taken to avoid collisions. A cooperative vehicle-infrastructure concept, built upon such premises, seek to combine the information available from vehicles and roadside in a synergistic framework so that a flexible yet sensible system can be deployed in the near future. The work presented in this paper represents an experimental effort conducted at a real-world intersection, by the use of an instrumented vehicte and roadside traffic monitoring, to explore technical challenges encountered in a vehicle-infrastructure integration approach.},

abstract = {Automatic video analysis from urban surveillance cameras is a fast-emerging field based on computer vision techniques. We present here a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art computer vision for traffic video with a critical analysis and an outlook to future research directions. This field is of increasing relevance for intelligent transport systems (ITSs). The decreasing hardware cost and, therefore, the increasing de- ployment of cameras have opened a wide application field for video analytics. Several monitoring objectives such as congestion, traffic rule violation, and vehicle interaction can be targeted using cameras that were typically originally installed for human oper- ators. Systems for the detection and classification of vehicles on highways have successfully been using classical visual surveillance techniques such as background estimation and motion tracking for some time. The urban domain is more challenging with respect to traffic density, lower camera angles that lead to a high degree of occlusion, and the variety of road users. Methods from object categorization and 3-D modeling have inspired more advanced techniques to tackle these challenges. There is no commonly used data set or benchmark challenge, which makes the direct com- parison of the proposed algorithms difficult. In addition, evalu- ation under challenging weather conditions (e.g., rain, fog, and darkness) would be desirable but is rarely performed. Future work should be directed toward robust combined detectors and classifiers for all road users, with a focus on realistic conditions during evaluation.},

@article{Zhao2012,
abstract = {In our previous work, we reported a system that monitors an intersection using a network of horizontal laser scanners. This paper focuses on an algorithm for moving-object detection and tracking, given a sequence of distributed laser scan data of an intersection. The goal is to detect each moving object that enters the intersection; estimate state parameters such as size; and track its location, speed, and direction while it passes through the intersection. This work is unique, to the best of the authors' knowledge, in that the data is novel, which provides new possibilities but with great challenges; the algorithm is the first proposal that uses such data in detecting and tracking all moving objects that pass through a large crowded intersection with focus on achieving robustness to partial observations, some of which result from occlusions, and on performing correct data associations in crowded situations. Promising results are demonstrated using experimental data from real intersections, whereby, for 1063 objects moving through an intersection over 20 min, 988 are perfectly tracked from entrance to exit with an excellent tracking ratio of 92.9\%. System advantages, limitations, and future work are discussed.},

Laser scanners are set on the road side to profile an intersection horizontally from different viewpoints. The contour points of moving objects are captured at a certain hori- zontal plane with a high scanning rate (e.g., 37 Hz). A laser-based processing algorithm is de- veloped, thus the moving objects entered the in- tersection are detected and tracked to estimate their state parameters, such as: location, speed, and direction at each time instance. In addition, laser data and processing results are forwarded to an associated video camera, so that a visual- ization as well as fusion-based processing can be achieved. An experiment in central Beijing is presented, demonstrating that a large quantity of physical dimension and detailed traffic data can be obtained through such a system.},

Each vehicle is modeled by an agent and each agent provides information depending on its vehicle sensors. Two intersection types, roundabout and crossroads, were simulated each using its intelligent traffic management system. Both intersections use an algorithm based on a spatio-temporal reservation scheme. The envisioned intelligent traffic management algorithm is supported by vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications, allowing the exchange of information between vehicles and the intersection intelligent traffic management system. The developed intelligent traffic management system is very well suited for autonomous vehicles, it can also be used by human drivers if they follow accurately the proposed speed profile along the path.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence research is ushering in a new era of sophisticated, mass-market transportation technology. While computers can already fly a passenger jet better than a trained human pilot, people are still faced with the dangerous yet tedious task of driving au- tomobiles. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is the field that focuses on integrating information technology with vehicles and transportation infrastructure to make transporta- tion safer, cheaper, and more efficient. Recent advances in ITS point to a future in which vehicles themselves handle the vast majority of the driving task. Once autonomous vehicles become popular, autonomous interactions amongst multiple vehicles will be possible. Cur- rent methods of vehicle coordination, which are all designed to work with human drivers, will be outdated. The bottleneck for roadway efficiency will no longer be the drivers, but rather the mechanism by which those drivers’ actions are coordinated. While open-road driving is a well-studied and more-or-less-solved problem, urban traffic scenarios, especially intersections, are much more challenging. We believe current methods for controlling traffic, specifically at intersections, will not be able to take advantage of the increased sensitivity and precision of autonomous vehicles as compared to human drivers. In this article, we suggest an alternative mechanism for coordinating the movement of autonomous vehicles through intersections. Drivers and intersections in this mechanism are treated as autonomous agents in a multiagent system. In this multiagent system, intersections use a new reservation-based approach built around a detailed communication protocol, which we also present. We demonstrate in simulation that our new mechanism has the potential to significantly outperform current intersection control technology—traffic lights and stop signs. Because our mechanism can emulate a traffic light or stop sign, it subsumes the most popular current methods of intersection control. This article also presents two extensions to the mechanism. The first extension allows the system to control human-driven vehicles in addition to autonomous vehicles. The second gives priority to emergency vehicles without significant cost to civilian vehicles. The mechanism, including both extensions, is implemented and tested in simulation, and we present experimental results that strongly attest to the efficacy of this approach.},

Dresner and Stone proposed a new intersection control protocol called Autonomous Intersection Management (AIM) and showed that with autonomous vehicles it is possible to make intersection control much more efficient than the traditional control mechanisms such as traffic signals and stop signs. The protocol, however, has only been tested in simulation and has not been evaluated with real autonomous vehicles. To realistically test the protocol, we implemented a mixed reality platform on which an autonomous vehicle can interact with multiple virtual vehicles in a simulation at a real intersection in real time. From this platform we validated realistic parameters for our autonomous vehicle to safely traverse an intersection in AIM. We present several techniques to improve efficiency and show that the AIM protocol can still outperform traffic signals and stop signs even if the cars are not as precisely controllable as has been assumed in previous studies.},
