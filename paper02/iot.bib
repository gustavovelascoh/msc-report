abstract = {With the development of information technology and the coming of the internet of things, traffic signal control has brought new opportunities and challenges. This paper presents a method of traffic network signal control, which used to optimize traffic signal timing, reduce the delay of vehicles within the network. The method is divided into two levels: intersection control level and network control level. Intersection control level uses a dynamic programming based adaptive algorithm. Network control level uses an optimization algorithm based on conflict decision tree, using the A* algorithm, rolling optimization and feedback control strategies to enhance the real-time, reliability and robustness of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the system has evaluated through an actual traffics network simulation conducted with VISSIM. Results show that the proposed method is significantly better than the time-of-day method in travel time, average delay and other parameters.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in vehicle fleet size and consequently in traffic volume is not always followed by an increase in road space. As a result, traffic congestion occurs, especially in large urban areas. Therefore, in order to avoid traffic jams, immediate solutions have to be found. Various technologies have been used to design and develop such solutions in the past. While some developers have used classic technologies, others have integrated various emerging technologies in the systems they built in order to make roadways safer. Acting both inside the vehicle and along the roadways the new designed systems are able to inform drivers about traffic conditions and possible hazards. This paper proposes an Internet of Things-based approach to solve some of the problems that traffic congestion raises. Furthermore, this approach provides the means to monitor a set of environmental parameters, including air quality, and to raise early warnings and alarms when critical levels are reached. This approach offers a solution to increasing traffic-related pollution (which has a negative impact on the environment and on people's health), to economic losses and to other issues caused by traffic congestions. In order to reduce accident risks when various intervention vehicles enter the cross-roads, we also propose a solution based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Currently, traffic signals in most countries have preset time periods for the red/yellow/green signals. Different roads in a city are configured with different time periods based on type and location of roads and the peak or off-peak hours. Such preset timings are inadequate in coping with unexpected situations such as a traffic accident or other natural disasters or specific unplanned events. Because the traffic control system is generally not adaptive enough, traffic congestion occurs often in most metropolitan cities. As a solution, we propose a smart traffic optimization system that can adjust the setting of traffic signals in real time based on sensor and camera inputs. In this work, we developed both a microscopic simulator with heuristic optimization, as well as, an embedded system prototype for traffic optimization. A genetic algorithm based optimization method is employed. The traffic simulator allows the user to collect statistical information on roads and also to check if an optimization decision (change in traffic signal timings) works or not. The embedded system prototype helps to realize and verify the actual deployment of the optimization decision. The integration of the simulator and the prototype helped to verify the feasibility of the proposed smart traffic optimization system. Experiment results validate that both the intersection average waiting rate and the intersection average waiting time decreased rapidly after optimization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Vehicular Ad-Hoc NETworks (VANETs) have received considerable attention in recent years, due to its unique characteristics, which are different from Mobile Ad-Hoc NETworks (MANETs), such as rapid topology change, frequent link failure, and high vehicle mobility. The main drawback of VANETs network is the network instability, which yields to reduce the network efficiency. This paper proposes a novel Intersection Dynamic VANET Routing (IDVR) protocol, which aims to increase the route stability, average throughput, and reduce end-to-end delay in a grid topology. We used a centralized Software Defined Network (SDN) to gather a real-time traffic information and provide the Intersection Cluster Head (ICH) a Set of Candidate Shortest Routes (SCSR). At the Intersection, An ICH algorithm is proposed based on the maximum Life Time (LT), the LT is the time that each vehicle requires till it leaves the cluster. The IDVR protocol selects the optimal route based on its current location, destination location, and the maximum of the minimum average throughput among the SCSR. We used SUMO traffic generator simulator and MATLAB to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol. Our proposed protocol outperforms many protocols mentioned in the literature, such as IRTIV, VDLA, and GPCR, in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput.},

@article{Li2017,
abstract = {This paper proposes a traffic flow control system at intersections for Internet of Vehicles by combining ideas from process scheduling in Operating Systems with a ticket mechanism. The paper models an intersection as a network of mutual exclusive resources and the vehicle flows as processes that access the resources. Two graph models: Flow Intersection Network and Flow Resource Allocation Network are introduced as intermediate representations to derive which traffic flows can "run" concurrently and how long they take. Based on this knowledge, the ticket based traffic control system uses a message protocol and two asynchronous processes: flow scheduler and flow coordinator to admit, schedule and coordinate concurrent vehicles through the intersection without collisions or deadlocks. Three classic scheduling algorithms: First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Service Time Next (SSTN), and Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN), are incorporated into the scheduler. The experiments on large scale simulated traffic data show the scheduling algorithm scales linearly with the number of traffic flows and vehicles. The tests also show that at low to medium traffic loads, the throughput and delay of the three algorithms are mixed, but at heavy traffic loads, SSTN and HRRN outperform the commonly used FCFS.},

Now days, to make the Social IoT (SIoT) a reality there are many on-going world-wide research initiatives and standardization efforts. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is an extension to the concept of SIoT that proposes Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV). SIoV is an example of SIoT, where Smart vehicles are the objects of SIoT that builds social relationship and interchanges information to enhance the driving knowledge and gives various services to the drivers. In this paper, the proposed Vehicular Social Networks based on the VIoT consist of a large number of sensors that transmit data wirelessly. However, the very high heterogeneity in hardware capabilities of things and QoS requirements for different applications limits the performance of classical layered protocol solutions and the existing cross-layer solutions for wireless sensor networks. The results show that the proposed VSNP (Vehicular Social Network Protocol) for VIoT based on WSN solution can achieve a global communication optimum and outperforms existing layered solutions. The novel cross-layer module is a primary step towards providing efficient traffic management and reliable vehicle to vehicle communication in the SIoT.

abstract = {This study focuses on the distributed traffic control system by inspiration of advanced connected vehicle technology. In this regard, we introduce an Internet of Agents (IoA) framework for connected vehicles where agents make their own decisions to improve the effectiveness of the system by connectivity and automatic negotiation with other agents. Specifically, each of the connected vehicles can be regarded as an agent which is able to communicate and collaborate with others based on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication technologies. A case study on distributed traffic control system without traffic signal is presented in this paper. In particular, we consider traffic control at intersection problem as a group mutual exclusion problem where only connected vehicles in non-conflict relationship are able to enter the core of intersection simultaneously. Therefore, we extend the Ricart–Agrawala based-logical clock algorithm to deal with this problem. Various parameters (e.g., number of message exchange, average waiting time, total number of vehicle passing) have been measured to evaluate our approach. The simulated results show that our approach outperforms compared with existing traffic systems and previous works.},

Furthermore, the exploitation of social networking notions into the IoV has brought to the definition of the Social IoV (SIoV) paradigm, i.e., a social network where every vehicle is capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with other vehicles or road infrastructure equipment. In this paper, we propose an implementation of the SIoV leveraging on an existing cloud-based IoT platform to manage the social activity of the vehicles as defined by the SIoV paradigm. The contribution of the paper is multifold: (i) we define some static and dynamic relationships that can be established between vehicles and road infrastructures taking part to the SIoV; (ii) we show how the proposed system can be integrated into the standard Intelligent Transportation System Station Architecture (ITS SA); (iii) we illustrate an effective low-cost and flexible solution for the On-Board Unit (OBU) to enable every vehicles to participate in the SIoV and create their own relationships; (iv) we show the results of the conducted experimental tests for the creation of social relationships aimed at comparing the performance of Bluetooth, 802.11p and Wi-Fi technologies when used to manage vehicles' radio visibility. Finally, we present two use cases: the Vehicle Diagnostic and the Smart Parking applications.},

abstract = {Internet of things is the interlink of devices, vehicles and other embedded objects to collect and exchange data. The intelligent transport system (ITS) with internet of things has become the solution for navigation of roads for vehicles, traffic control systems, and automated number plate identification. It has been advanced in applications for providing live data and feedback from various sources such as weather information, parking guidance and updated traffic information from time to time. The proposed system focuses on dynamic traffic light sequence based on the traffic density is used to reduce the accidents at intersection. The obstacles that may or may not occur at intersection are sensed and warned by buzzer and a message. The traffic management is monitored and the current status of traffic data is retrieved and the violators are being identified. This is essentially done to reduce the traffic congestion and accidents at peak hours.},

@article{NamBui2018,
abstract = {In this study, we focus on optimizing traffic flow at multiple intersections. Particularly, with the development of Internet of Things, intersection controllers are regarded as smart agents which can communicate and coordinate with each other. In this regard, a cooperative game theoretic approach among agents is proposed to improve traffic flow with large network. Thereby, a distributed merge and split algorithm for coalition formation is presented. This algorithm is applied to find out how to incorporate with the cooperation among agents for dynamically controlling traffic light at intersections. Furthermore, we construct a traffic simulation framework to evaluate our approach. With various parameters for traffic density, our proposed system can effectively improve traffic flow in both uniform and non-uniform. In particular, by coordinating among controllers, the waiting time of vehicles at intersections can be reduced from 15{\%} to 25{\%} comparing with previous methods (e.g., Green Wave Coordination).},
